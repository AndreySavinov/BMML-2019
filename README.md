# BMML-2019
This folder contains completed homeworks for Bayesian Methods of Machine Learning 2019 Skoltech course. Coding task are completed via PyTorch. 
Unfortnately, I haven't manage to find files for train and test of neural networks, because google account I used for Colab has been deleted by google.
